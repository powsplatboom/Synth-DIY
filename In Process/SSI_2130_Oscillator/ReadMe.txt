This is the KiCad workspace for my take on a eurorack implementation of the SSI2130 oscillator chip from Sound Semiconductor Inc.
This is tested and working, aside from needing to adjust the tuning range of the trim pots.
There is also still need to code the arduino to implement the tuner functionality.
There is also a small error in labelling on the faceplate, the trim pots are incorrectly labelled.
These boards use a 16-pin power header, and use pin 1 and 2 of the power header to recieve pitch information from my eurorack.
If you do not want to use the internal pitch function, simply leave off the tactile switch on the front of the board.
