Replacement design for the stereo mixer I built previously. 
Works relatively well, but panning circuit need reworked to achieve constant power panning. Distortion gain needs adjusted to achieve more constant volume.
Likely to switch to the SSI2164 with the redesign to save on cost and board size. The AS3360 is a finnicky chip that requires too many external components to function.
Will also be adding expandability to the board so that a microphone pre-amp can be added as a separate upgrade.
Would also like to add mute switches to all channels.
